 Datasets name: UFC Complete Dataset (All events 1996-2024)


ðŸŒ¸ The UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) is an American mixed martial arts promotion company which is considered the biggest promotion in the MMA World. Soon they will host an anniversary event UFC 300. It is interesting to see what path the promotion has come from 1996 to this day. There are UFC datasets available in the Kaggle but all of them are outdated. For that matter I've decided to gather the new dataset which will include most of the useful stats you can do for various data analysis tasks and put my theoretical skills into practice.
